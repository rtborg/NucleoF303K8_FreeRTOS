# Nucleo F303K8
Nucleo F303K8 (STM32F303K8T6) bare metal FreeRTOS project

Important considerations: The Nucleo F303K8 does not have an external oscillator for the STM32F303K8T6 chip, but the clock for the ST-LINK debugger can be utilized. You need to manually open bridge SB6 and close bridge SB4, after that HSE 8MHz can be selected in the clock configuration (as in this project).

The project files are automatically generated by STM32CubeMX with the following settings:
- Clock: 72MHz
- USART2 (virtual com port) enabled
- PB3 set up as output (user LED)
- FreeRTOS incuded
- TIM2 used as SysClock timebase

A brief overview of the procedure for creating an STM32CubeMX project for using in Eclipse:

1) Prerequisites: Eclipse with arm-gcc-eabi and OpenOCD installed
2) Create STM32CubeMX project and configure peripherals
3) Generate code for SW4STM32 platform
4) Create an empty C project in Eclipse and copy all autogenerated files from step 3
5) Update include paths for the preprocessor and the compiler 
6) Define the required symbols. For example, this project defines the following symbols:
	__weak='__attribute__((weak))'
	__packed='__attribute__((packed))'
	USE_HAL_DRIVER
	STM32F303K8Tx
	NUCLEO_F303K8
	USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
	STM32F303x8
	DEBUG
7) Specify the path to the linker script
8) Rename the startup file - extension is .S and not .s

The project should now compile provided that the toolchain is set up correctly.
